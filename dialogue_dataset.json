Use bleach or a sanitizing product. Some people swear by vinegar, personally I don't. I have a big family with teenage boys.

If the important conversations don't happen at home, kids will turn to the internet, and some information out there is misinformed, misleading, or both. When I was growing up in Canada, we got Sex Ed twice in school. Once in elementary school (4th grade), and again in 8th grade. 4th grade wasn't really Sex Ed, it was more like Body Ed. It was essential for me because my parents never talked about any of it. It was so damn useful and it made everything so much less scary.\n\nWe were separated into boys and girls. The girls had a female teacher who taught us all about periods‚Äîwhat they were, what was happening in our bodies with pictures and a plastic model of the female reproductive system passed around. We learned about menstrual pads and tampons and how to use them; those were passed around as well so we could touch and play with them and just get familiar with them, even though most of us were years ahead of using them. We were also told that our first period or two might look a bit weird, but that's normal, and the school nurse also keeps pads around in case we get our first period while at school.\n\nWe also learned about puberty and what other things would start happening; primary and secondary sexual characteristics. *Together.* Boys and girls in one group. We also learned about male anatomy, and vice versa. The amount of giggling was absolutely wild, as you might expect. Importantly, the teachers also spent a while teaching us about what inappropriate touching by grownups looked like, where we should never be touched, and to tell an adult right away if it happened. I thought was a really insightful addition. Many kids in sexually abusive situations might not even know the touching was inappropriate.\n\nLooking back now as an adult, I truly appreciate how much easier it made the experience of puberty for me and how fortunate I was. Every kid should have the opportunity to receive this kind of education, imo. It's such essential information."

But for a lot of us, III was like a bolt of lightning because there wasn't even close to another game like that for consoles, but when Vice came out it was just like a bright neon version of III with a soundtrack that never got old and completely immersed you in the theme.\n\nObviously SA is an even bigger jump from VC, but it just wasn't as special to me. Maybe it was because I was obsessed with the 80's when I was young and Vice just felt like a perfect 80's simulator, and maybe its just because SA was so much more involved that you couldn't just sit down and beat it in one day like you could with Vice.\n\nStill, two amazing games that I hope the younger generation appreciates (and they should definitely play the originals rather than the remasters)"
